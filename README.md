Trekwar multiplayer 4x turn based strategy game set in the Star Trek universe.

:no_entry: Project Abandoned

Due to lack of time and interest in using Java, development on this game has been abandoned.  The Trekwar Server and Client are both in a usable state and working fairly well and would allow you to start a game, add users and allow them to play the game.
