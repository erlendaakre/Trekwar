Trekwar 0.4.55 Changelog
========================
- Colonyships now correctly remove population from the system it's built in, and each additional colony module will provide the newly 
  built colony with 2 new factories and 1 power plant (up to max 3 colony modules per colonyship).
- Maximum population and fertility reduced for all planets.
- Minor adjustment to structure stats (sligthly increased outputs mostly).
- Terran and Barren planets have their number of slots reduced by 3 and 1.
- If a shipyard is destroyed/demolished/disabled any ship in production will now halt.
- Shipyard icon now shown on starsystem "box" over the bottom menu if system has shipyard.
- Drag/drop is no longer used to build ships in system control window, instead use the new build button.
- Unexplored tiles will no longer be selected at start of turn if no other tile is clicked after issuing a move order to the unexplored tile.
- Fleets now have a cancel order button.
- List of special sturctures removed from system control window.
- Ship stats in the ship building window in the star system management window now has labels.
- Fleet and template names can now have space and special characters (like B'rel) in them.
- Ship upkeep added (each ship needs X number of industry per turn), each star system will add 8.3% of it's total industry surplus 
  to the empire-wide upkeep pool (If the system has an active shipyard the amount added is 11.1%).
- Not having enough ship upkeep will cause the following effects PER TURN:
    - 25% chance to delay every ship construction order by 1 turn
    - 30% chance to fail refuel and taking on more crew per ship
    - 70% chance to fail repair of a ship
    - 25% chance for a ship to loose morale
    - 20% chance for a fleet (not per ship) to not do a sensor update
    - 6/4/2% chance for a ship to take light/moderate/severe damage.
- Ships can now be decommissioned or use the self destruct, both of these will IMMEDIATELY remove the ship from the game,
  decomission can only be done in a friendly system. If the system is currently building a ship then 25% of the industry cost
  of the ship being decommissioned will be used to hurry production of the new ship. If the system is building a structure
  12.5% of the ship value is used to hurry production.
- Proper server side logging implemented. Added more extensive logging
- Main gui (mainly current reserach + research not set notification) now correctly updated when first connecting to server.
- Starsystems industry/power/research/food values now only shown as surplus(available) and in absolute values, not using green/red bars.
- Visual adjustments to deuterium/ore/defense and sensor information for starsystems in the bottom menu.
- Selecting a tech in the Research View will now show all components/hull which require the selected tech in black and white icons,
  as well as the components/hull gained from researching the selected tech in colour icons.
- Fixed bug #4, creating new fleets when ships are built and putting ships into these auto-created fleets now works better.
- No longer possible to have the server store invalid ship templates.
- ShipTemplate and Ship classes refactored (no longer any duplicate code)
- Minor fixes to client error handling




Trekwar 0.4.51 Changelog
========================
- bright white screen when loading server data each turn changed to avoid melting the alpha testers eyeballs.
- IO error while disconnecting should no longer show up at all, but if it does it will not be in an infinite loop.
- Additional error information shown with errors in client.
- Misc. logging added to assist in debugging on serverside.
- fleet speeds now shown in tiles per turn (0.8 instead of 8.. and 1.3 instead of 13), this does not mean everything is nivubg 10 times slower, DON'T PANIC!
- title of research window (research output) is now updated properly each turn if reserach changes.
- when giving a move order, the distance to the selected system will now be shown. This makes all complaints about "running out of gas" invalid.
- default structures in colonized system changed (the days of free Ore Refinery are long gone, but you'll get slightly more industry in starting systems).
- bonus structures (from additional colonization modules in colony ship) now more predictable (more likely to give bonus factories and some power).
- The chance of getting a free Shipyard as a bonus from colonizing has dropped from 'small' (6.25%) to 'when Vulcan freezes over' (0.00%).
- systems should have fewer planets on average, output of industry/power/farm/lab increased slightly to weigh up for the loss.
- Minor adjustments to buildings (output/requirements in industry/research/power/food).
- All ship components have increased in cost (industry), just because I could, and this is my way of getting back at the universe for all the times I've been the victim of nerfs in games for the last 15 years.
- Colonize button will no longer show for fleets who are already colonizing a system
- Minimap in bottom window now scales, big improvement over previous buggy version but still not perfect. At least it's somewhat usable now :)
- Research bar next to minimap now has number of turns written on it.
- Reserach bar next to minimap will no longer be animated and red if no reserach is selected if everything has been researched.
- Rounding error in research turn to completion fixed.
- User list in chat window now properly updated.
- Clicking an empty system with one of your fleets in it will now show the fleet in the bottom menu instead of detailed information about empty space.
- Time to colonize systems slightly changed.
- Small rocky planets will now be closer to the sun (listed higher in the system manager), while gas giants will be further away (listed lower).
- Crashed clients users may or may not linger in the list of logged in users :)
